
    There are multiple assessments,   
    benchmarking and certification 
    platforms for professionals 
    learning to code. 

    However, for K12 Coding 
    education, there was a void of 
    a global organization that 
    could assess, benchmark, and 
    certify the learning outcome 
    and skills for students aged 6-16. 

    BrainHacks fills that void 
    with a platform for children 
    as well, where they can 
    benchmark their skills and 
    prepare themseleves a bit early 
    for their coding journey.
