    rounds of a variety of 
    algorithmic challenges 
    designed by our very own 
    Engineers,

    Participants can compete in 
    one or all online rounds
    held throughout the year, 
    and will have the opportunity   
    to develop and grow their 
    programming abilities 
    while getting a glimpse 
    into the technical skills 
    needed for their career 

    (top participants 
    may be invited for interview).
